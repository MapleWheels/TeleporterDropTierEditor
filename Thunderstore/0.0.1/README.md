This plugin allows you to edit how the teleporter item drop behaves.

The following options are available:
- Drop Uniformity: The teleporter boss wil only drop one item type instead of multiple (ie. some greens and some yellows).
- Select what tiers of items can be dropped from the teleporter.
- Set a weighted chance for each tier to be chose to spawn.
- Set a multiplier for the amount of items of that specific tier that will be spawned.
